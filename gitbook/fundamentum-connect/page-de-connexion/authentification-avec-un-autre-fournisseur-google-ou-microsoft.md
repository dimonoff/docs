# Authentication with another provider (Google or Microsoft)

Fundamentum also supports login via external identity providers, such as Google or Microsoft.\
This method allows users to authenticate using their existing professional or personal credentials, without having to create a platform-specific password.

1. On the sign-in page, click “Log in with Google” or “Log in with Microsoft.”
2. A secure authentication window from the selected provider will open.
3. Enter your usual login details (email address and password associated with your Google or Microsoft account).
4.  Once authentication is successful, you will be automatically redirected to the platform.\
