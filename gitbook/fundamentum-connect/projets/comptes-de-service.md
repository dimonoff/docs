# Service accounts

\
A **service account** is a type of non-human user, typically used by machines, applications, or devices to access the platform in an automated way.\
By clicking on the **Service Accounts** tab in the left sidebar menu, you can access the management interface for service accounts.

From this section, you can create, edit, or archive service accounts using the buttons located on the right side of the screen.\
When a service account is archived, it is no longer active but can be restored at any time directly from the database if needed.<br>

To create a service account, click the **“Create Service Account”** button located at the top right of the interface.\
A window or form will appear, prompting you to enter an identifier. This identifier must contain at least three characters.

After creating your service account, two new sections will appear:

* **Service Account Roles**
* **API Keys**

These features work the same way as they do for a standard user.\
The process for creating or deleting a token is exactly the same as the one described in the **“My Account”** section.\
As for the role, you simply need to select it from the dropdown menu to assign it to the service account.<br>

The "API Keys" tab opens a token management section, where you can create new tokens or delete existing ones.\
At the bottom of the screen, you can view the list of service account roles, with the option to remove them or assign a new one if needed.<br>
