The main page of the Users section allows you to view and manage all accounts that have access to the project. It is the central point for supervising user permissions, activity, and status.

This page displays a table containing the essential information for each user:

* **Email:** The email address used to access the platform.
* **Name:** The user’s full name.
* **Role:** The role assigned to the user, defining their permissions within the project.
* **Invitation:** The date and time when the user was invited to the project.
* **Status:** The current state of the invitation or the user account:
  * **Pending:** Indicates that the user has received the invitation but has not yet accepted it.
  * **Completed:** Indicates that the user has finished setting up their account, including choosing a password, and has accepted the role assigned in the invitation.

**Filtering users**

At the top of the table, a dropdown menu titled **All Users** allows you to filter the display by different user types (e.g., Project Manager, Devices Manager, Insight Manager, etc.).\

**Modify a user**

#### User whose profile is not yet completed or validated

If the user’s profile has not yet been completed/validated, an **Edit** button is available.\
Click **Edit**.\
You can then modify the following fields:

* Role
* Last name
* First name
* Email address
* Language

Save the changes.

#### User whose profile is completed and account is validated

If the user’s profile is already completed and the account is validated, the **Edit** button is no longer available.

In this case, it is not possible to directly modify the existing user.\
You must:

* Create a new user.
* Fill in and edit the following fields:
  * Role
  * Last name
  * Email address
  * Language

The original user will remain unchanged, and the new user must be used instead.

A user can appear multiple times in the list if he has different roles.
