# About

Welcome to the user documentation for our IoT device management application suite, which includes two main applications: **Hub** and **Connect**.

**Connect** is the application responsible for managing access and permissions. It provides fine-grained control over who can access your devices and which actions they are authorized to perform. With Connect, you can define user roles, assign specific permissions, and ensure the security of your IoT network.

**Hub** is the application dedicated to device management. It enables you to monitor, control, and configure your IoT devices in an intuitive and efficient way. Whether you manage a single device or an entire fleet, Hub simplifies daily operations and helps maintain optimal performance.

Together, **Hub** and **Connect** provide a complete solution for managing and securing your IoT ecosystem. This documentation will guide you through their features, configuration options, and best practices to help you get the most out of these applications.
