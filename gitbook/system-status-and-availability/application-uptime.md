# Application Uptime

[Application Status Dashboard](https://status.dimonoff.com/)\
\
This page is the official status dashboard for Dimonoff’s services and applications.\
It provides real-time visibility into the operational status of the various products and components (SCMS, Spatium, Fundamentum, and the associated APIs), as well as their availability over the past 90 days. Each service is displayed with an availability indicator (“UPTIME”), allowing users to quickly see whether applications are fully operational, experiencing performance issues, or undergoing scheduled maintenance.\
The page also allows users to subscribe to notifications via email or Slack/Microsoft Teams to receive updates in the event of an incident or a status change.
